# Box Transform

[Box Transform](boxTransform) is a **pure-Dart** base package that allows you to programmatically handle box
**resizing** and **dragging** without relying on [Flutter](flutter). It provides highly flexible, programmatically
resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any Dart project.

## Models

[Box Transform](boxTransform) defines several models to mimic that of Flutter's.

- The equivalent of `Size` is `Dimension`.
- The equivalent of `Offset` is `Vector2` from the `vector_math` package.
- The equivalent of `Rect` is `Box`.
- The equivalent of `BoxConstraints` is `Constraints`.

The APIs are very similar to Flutter's, so you should be able to pick it up quickly or be able to reference Flutter's
documentation for more information.

## Resizing

Resizing is done by using the static `BoxTransformer.resize` function. It takes in several parameters:

- `initialBox`: An immutable `Box` object representing the original size and position of the box before resizing.
- `initialLocalPosition`: A Vector2 object representing the initial position of the mouse cursor relative to the box.
- `localPosition`: A `Vector2` object representing the current position of the mouse cursor relative to the box.
- `handle`: A `HandlePosition` object representing the handle that is being used to resize the box.
- `resizeMode`: A `ResizeMode` object representing the mode in which the box is being resized.
- `initialFlip`: A `Flip` object representing the initial state of the box.
- `clampingRect`: A `Box` object representing the bounds within which the box can be resized.
- `constraints`: A `Constraints` object representing the constraints that limit the minimum and maximum size of the box.

The function returns a `ResizeResult` object that contains information about the resized box.

  handle: HandlePosition.bottomRight,

  localPosition: Offset.zero,

final Box box = Box.fromLTWH(50, 50, 100, 100);

final ResizeResult result = BoxTransformer.resize(
  handle: HandlePosition.bottomRight,
  initialBox: box,
  initialLocalPosition: Vector2.zero(),
  localPosition: Vector2.zero(),
  resizeMode: ResizeMode.freeform,
  initialFlip: Flip.none,
);
```
      </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Internally, the function calculates the difference between the initial position of the mouse cursor and the current
position, and uses this delta to resize the box according to the specified resizing mode and handle position.

The resulting box is then checked to ensure that it falls within the specified bounds and constraints.

If the resizing reaches a minimum or maximum width or height, the function sets flags in the ResizeResult object to
indicate that these limits have been reached.
