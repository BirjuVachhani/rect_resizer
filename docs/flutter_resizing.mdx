# Resizing

`TransformableBox` can be used to resize a widget by default. [Transformable Box](transformableBox) utilizes 
[Box Transform](boxTransform) to create a fully-featured Flutter implementation of the [Box Transform](boxTransform) API.

```dart title="Resizable widget"
  Stack(
    children: [
      TransformableBox(
        rect: rect,
        flip: flip,
        onChanged: (event) {
          setState(() {
            this.rect = event.rect;
            this.flip = event.flip;
          });
        },
        contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) => Image.asset( // your widget goes here.
          'assets/images/landscape.jpg',
          width: rect.width,
          height: rect.height,
          fit: BoxFit.fill,
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
```

<Info>**_onChanged_** callback is a general callback that is called whenever a change is made to the box. To listen to specific
changes, you can use **_onResized_** and **_onMoved_** callbacks for resizing and moving respectively.</Info>

By default, resizing allows flipping the rect horizontally and vertically. Flipping is done by using the 
`Transform.scale` widget with negative scale values.

Resizing is freeform by default, meaning that the user can resize the box in any direction and in any size.

## Controlling Resize Modes

The `resolveResizeModeCallback` is a callback that is called whenever a resize operation is about to be performed on a
given [Transformable Box](transformableBox). This allows you to define the resize behavior at the time of the resize 
operation. This is useful when you want to change the resize behavior based on the state of the application.

The most common use case for this is **keyboard shortcuts**. A `defaultResolveResizeModeCallback` function is used by 
default when resizing, and it's job is to listen to keyboard meta keys to change the `ResizeMode`.

### Default Resize Mode:

1. ResizeMode.freeform: **Default** mode. When no keys are pressed.
2. ResizeMode.scale: When `Shift` key is pressed.
3. ResizeMode.symmetric: When `Alt` key is pressed.
4. ResizeMode.symmetricScale: When both `Shift` and `Alt` keys are pressed.

See [ResizeModes](/resize_modes) page for more information on the different resize modes.

Override this default behavior by providing `resolveResizeModeCallback` in `TransformableBox` constructor to customize
resizing to your liking. This can also be used to allow only certain resize modes.

```dart title="Resizing with preseving aspect ratio"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    resolveResizeModeCallback: () => ResizeMode.scale,
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```
This will resize the box such that the **aspect ratio** is preserved.

## Flipping

By default, resizing allows flipping the rect horizontally and vertically. Flipping is done by using the
`Transform.scale` widget with negative scale values internally. There are two kinds of flipping involved in resizing:

### Flipping the rect while resizing
While resizing, the rect can be flipped horizontally and vertically whenever the
user drags a handle beyond the opposite side of the rect. This allows more flexibility in resizing the box. However,
this is not responsible for flipping the content of the box.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `flipRectWhileResizing` to `false`.

```dart title="Disable flipping the rect while resizing"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    flipRectWhileResizing: false,
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```

### Flipping the content of the box
This is done by using the `Transform.scale` widget with negative scale values. This
is done to allow the content to be flipped horizontally and vertically. 

This behavior can be disabled by setting `flipChild` to `false`.

```dart title="Disable flipping the child/content of the box"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    flipChild: false,
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```

You can set both `flipRectWhileResizing` and `flipChild` to `false` to disable flipping completely.

## Constraints

Resizing can be constrained by providing `minSize` and `maxSize` using `constraints` property.

```dart title="Resizable widget with constrained resizing"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    constraints: BoxConstraints(
      minWidth: 100,
      minHeight: 100,
      maxWidth: 500,
      maxHeight: 500,
    ),
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```
This will allow resizing the box between 100x100 and 500x500 pixels.

### Constraint callbacks

You can register callbacks to listen to when the box reaches the minimum or maximum size. This is useful when you want
to react to these events to show some UI indication like showing a message or changing border color.

You can register `onTerminalSizeReached` callback to listen to when the box reaches the terminal size. This is useful
when you want to show a message to the user that the box has reached the maximum size.

<Info>A **terminal size** is a size that is either the **minimum** or **maximum** size of the box on either axis. 
This can happen when the user tries to resize the box beyond the given **constraints** or the size reaches the 
`clampingRect` size.</Info>

```dart title="onTerminalSizeReached callback"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    constraints: BoxConstraints(
      minWidth: 100,
      minHeight: 100,
      maxWidth: 500,
      maxHeight: 500,
    ),
    onTerminalSizeReached: (
        bool reachedMinWidth,
        bool reachedMaxWidth,
        bool reachedMinHeight,
        bool reachedMaxHeight,
      ) {
        // do something here.
    },
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```

You can also use `onMinWidthReached`, `onMaxWidthReached`, `onMinHeightReached` and `onMaxHeightReached` callbacks to 
listen to the individual terminal size events. You can also use `onTerminalWidthReached` and `onTerminalHeightReached` to listen
to combined terminal width and height events respectively.

## Disable Resizing

Resizing can be disabled by setting the `resizable` property to `false`.

```dart title="Resizable widget without resizing"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    resizable: false,
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```
