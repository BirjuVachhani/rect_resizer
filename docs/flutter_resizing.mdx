title: Transformable Box
---

[Transformable Box](transformableBox) is a Flutter widget that fully utilizes [Box Transform](boxTransform) to create
a fully-featured Flutter implementation of the [Box Transform](boxTransform) API.

This widget exists out of convenience and is not essentially, but rather heavily simplifies the usage and implementation
of a box that can be transformed. It is maximally customizable.

## Usage

The API of this widget is made in such a way so as to allow you to use it in several ways. Let's take a look at the
constructor first:

```dart
  const TransformableBox({
    super.key,
    required this.contentBuilder,
    this.onChanged,
    this.onMoved,
    this.onResized,
    this.controller,
    this.handleBuilder = _defaultHandleBuilder,
    this.handleGestureResponseDiameter = 24,
    this.handleRenderedDiameter = 12,
    // raw
    Rect? box,
    Flip? flip,
    Rect? clampingRect,
    BoxConstraints? constraints,
    ResolveResizeModeCallback? resolveResizeModeCallback,
    // terminal update events
    this.onMinWidthReached,
    this.onMaxWidthReached,
    this.onMinHeightReached,
    this.onMaxHeightReached,
    this.onTerminalWidthReached,
    this.onTerminalHeightReached,
    this.onTerminalSizeReached,
  });
```

### Method 1 - Using the controller

The first method is to use the controller to control the box. This is the most flexible method and allows you to
control the transformable box externally with proper state management.

To create a controller, you can use the `TransformableBoxController` class. It mirrors a lot of the observed parameters
in the constructor excluding `contentBuilder`, `handleBuilder`, `handleGestureResponseDiameter` and
`handleRenderedDiameter` since these are accessibility and rendering specific features.

```dart
final TransformableBoxController controller = TransformableBoxController();
```

When using a controller, you should not use the following parameters: `box`, `flip`, `clampingRect`, `constraints`,
and `resolveResizeModeCallback`. These are all intrinsically managed by the controller.

Be sure to manage your `controller`'s lifecycle properly. You can use the `dispose` method to dispose of the controller
and release its resources.

```dart
class MySexyBox extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MySexyBoxState createState() => _MySexyBoxState();
}

class _MySexyBoxState extends State<MySexyBox> {
  final TransformableBoxController controller = TransformableBoxController(
    resolveResizeModeCallback: (ResizeMode mode) { /* ... */ }, // optional.
  );

  @override
  void dispose() {
    controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TransformableBox(
      controller: controller,
      contentBuilder: (context, box) { /* ... */ },
    );
  }
}
```

### Method 2 - Using the raw parameters

The second method is to use the raw parameters to control the box. This allows you to control the box without
using a controller. The [Transformable Box](transformableBox) widget will handle the lifecycle of an internal
controller automatically for you.

To use the raw parameters, you should not use the `controller` parameter. You can use the following parameters:
`box`, `flip`, `clampingRect`, `constraints`, and `resolveResizeModeCallback`.

```dart
class MySexierBox extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MySexierBoxState createState() => _MySexierBoxState();
}

class _MySexierBoxState extends State<MySexierBox> {
  Rect box = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 100, 100);
  Flip flip = Flip.none; // optional to handle flip behavior.

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TransformableBox(
      box: box,
      flip: flip, // optional.
      clampingRect: Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 200, 200), // optional.
      constraints: BoxConstraints(minWidth: 50, minHeight: 50), // optional.
      resolveResizeModeCallback: (ResizeMode mode) { /* ... */ }, // optional.
      onChanged: (UIBoxTransformResult result) {
        setState(() {
          this.box = result.box;
          this.flip = result.flip;
        });
      },
      contentBuilder: (context, box) { /* ... */ },
    );
  }
}
```

## ResolveResizeModeCallback

The `resolveResizeModeCallback` is a callback that is called whenever a resize operation is about to be performed on a
given [Transformable Box](transformableBox) The reason this is a callback is because it allows you to define the
resize behavior at the time of the resize operation. This is useful when you want to change the resize behavior
based on the state of the application.

The most common use case for this is keyboard shortcuts. We provide a `defaultResolveResizeModeCallback`
function that is used by default when resizing, and it's job is to listen to keyboard meta keys to change the
`ResizeMode`. It sets the `ResizeMode` to `ResizeMode.scale` when the `Shift` key is pressed, `ResizeMode.symmetric`
when the `Alt` key is pressed, and `ResizeMode.symmetricScale` when both the `Shift` and `Alt` keys are pressed.
`ResizeMode.freeform` is used otherwise.

You can use this callback to change the `ResizeMode` of the resize operation however you like and can provide a
fixed-behavior callback if desired.

`resolveResizeModeCallback: (ResizeMode mode) => ResizeMode.symmetric,`
