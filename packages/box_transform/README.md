[Box Transform](https://github.com/hyper-designed/box_transform) is a pure-Dart base package that allows you to
programmatically handle box resizing and dragging without relying on Flutter. It provides a highly flexible,
programmatically resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any Dart project.

## Features

* üìè **Dimension Constraining:** Set maximum and minimum constraints to keep boxes within specific boundaries while
  resizing.
* üîÅ **Flipping Mechanics:** Advanced positional-flipping when resizing hits extreme values with hard constraints.
* üîí **Drag Clamping:** Specify clamping boxes to keep your transformable boxes within a specific region.
* üé® **Flexible Resizing Modes:** Choose from four different resizing modes for more flexibility in how boxes are
  resized.
* üìç **Customizable Anchor Points:** Define resizing corner-handles to anchor different parts of the box when resizing.
* üöÄ **Easy Integration:** Integrate Box Transform into your Dart or Flutter project with ease.
