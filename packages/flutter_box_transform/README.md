[Flutter Box Transform](https://github.com/hyper-designed/box_transform) is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) package
that allows you to programmatically handle box resizing and dragging using Flutter widgets. It provides highly
flexible, programmatically resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any Flutter project.

This package uses [Box Transform](https://pub.dev/packages/box_transform) APIs internally.

## Features

* üìè **Dimension Constraining:** Set maximum and minimum constraints to keep boxes within specific boundaries while
  resizing.
* üîÅ **Flipping Mechanics:** Advanced positional-flipping when resizing hits extreme values with hard constraints.
* üîí **Drag Clamping:** Specify clamping boxes to keep your transformable boxes within a specific region.
* üé® **Flexible Resizing Modes:** Choose from four different resizing modes for more flexibility in how boxes are
  resized.
* üìç **Customizable Anchor Points:** Define resizing corner-handles to anchor different parts of the box when resizing.
* üé® **Customizable Handles:** Use default resizing handles or define your own custom handles.
* üöÄ **Easy Integration:** Integrate Box Transform into your Flutter project with ease using widgets.
